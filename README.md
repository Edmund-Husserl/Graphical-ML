# Graphical-ML
## Introduction
The Graphical ML is a tool aimed to build a connection between machine learning model and graphical interface. This project is powered by the SOCRAT web platform ([https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT](https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT)). The SOCRAT platform is a dynamic web toolbox for interactive data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Ideas and Background
Machine learning models are useful tools both in industry and academia, providing powerful analysis of data. However, using machine learning models is often painful for people with no programming background. There are many things that are not related to research and work that need to be mastered, such as environment configuration and model training. 
Our goal is to make a tool with a graphical interface that can customize machine learning models and train them remotely according to the researcher's wishes. This will greatly reduce the threshold of using machine learning. And it can take advantage of remote computing and data resources.
